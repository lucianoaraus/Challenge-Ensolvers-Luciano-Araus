# Challenge Ensolvers

This proyect was made for the Ensolvers challenge. Owner: Luciano Araus

## Decisions:

The project started with the idea of being done with React, but then it ended up being done with pure vanilla javascript with the aim of later migrating to React.

## Data structure:

For the format of organizing tasks by folders, I decided to use a Class structure with arrays.
